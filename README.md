# Audio-deepfake-detection

Foundation models have become powerful tools for generating text, images, and audio, often outperforming traditional methods. However, their ability to create highly convincing outputs poses significant security risks, particularly in the realm of AI-generated deepfake audio. These advanced techniques can easily bypass existing classifiers designed to distinguish legitimate, human-generated input from malicious manipulations. In this project, we focus on developing efficient and robust methods to detect AI-generated deepfake audio. By analyzing advanced attack strategies and leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, our goal is to enhance the security and reliability of audio-based systems against deepfake threats.
